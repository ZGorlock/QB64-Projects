<#b1><#l84><#c10>The Genesis</#c></#l> - 
	The Supreme Beings of the Astral planes of existance once gathered in a void area of the Material Realm. Their goal was to align their mana fields to create a new material plane; the Prime Material Plane. They sang the plane into being, and in an instance, all of the infinities of space and time burst into existance. The Supreme Beings drew from the matter of the Elemental Material Planes and filled the Prime Material Plane with its matrix of prime material. In addition, each Being flooded the Plane with its own field of mana, the energy that would act as fuel to animate the matrix; the life force of the Plane. It was agreed that each Being's mana would be kept in balance so that no one alignment gained too much power over the plane, so no one Being would become more powerful than the others. For the Plane acts as a two-way energy source: the Supreme Being would make available Its mana for the beings of the plane and in return, the more the life force of the plane aligns with a Being's mana field, the more powerful and more prominent It becomes. The Beings, together, chose an area at the center of the Plane and decided to focus their mana on it. This land was named Lorria and would act as the spiritual epicenter of the Prime Material Plane. Each of the Supreme Beings created life for Lorria: vegetation, creatures, and beasts, and, finally, a race of free-willed planar beings to represent and honor Its astral plane. These races of angels, each of a different alignment, would live together peacfully, resulting in a mutually beneficial, symbiotic link between the Prime Material Plane and the Astral Planes. The Prime Material Plane would forever act as a shadow of the Astral, Ethereal, and Material Planes; the focal point of the new Multiverse, and at the heart of this Plane was the Land of Lorria.

<#b2><#c10>The First Age</#c> - 
	For tens of thousands of cycles, the angels of Lorria lived in perfect harmony. The angels of each Supreme Being lived amoungst each other peacefully, sharing everything and helping each other. They used their power of creation to construct incredible structures and mold the world as they saw fit. They lived without troubles, conflict, or fear. Arconia, the Supreme Being of absolute Chaotic Evil, grew tired of this, however, and over time She slowly increased the presence of her mana field in Lorria, breaking the oath They took when They first created the Prime Material Plane. This increase in Chaotic Evil mana density manifested itself in anger, fear, greed, jealously, and hatred amoung the angels. They lost their harmony and their existances began to conflict. These conflicts would eventually result in The Great War.

<#b3><#c10>The Great War</#c> - 
	As tensions grew during The First Age, the angels started to form alliances amoung their races and battle with the other alliances. These battles were over things like territory and resources, they had forgoten how to coexist. The battles became more and more frequent and destructive and eventually the alliances declared war on each other. These battles had left a scar on Lorria that would never heal, this was now called The Badlands. Arconia had grown so powerful that she was able to create a God out of the darkness and evil that plagued Lorria, she called this God Andros and hid him deep within The Abyss. The alliances of Lorria began to use their power of creation to construct huge weapons of war, weapons that would be capable of tearing the Plane apart. All sides stocked up on these weapons, neither side willing to use them until absolutely necessary. A hundred cycles passed at this stalemate until, eventually, the angel armies gathered in the Plains of Eckldor to end the War. They armed their weapons and prepared for a battle they knew would lead to nothing but destruction. The Supreme Beings of the Astral Planes could stand by no longer, they put an end to this War and prepared to rebalance the Plane. This rebalancing would be remembered as The Regenesis.

<#b4><#c10>The Regenesis</#c> - 
	The Supreme Beings of the Astral Planes watched the angels of Lorria fall to the influence of the darkness and slip into war, war that would destroy them. They had to intervene to end the War and save the Plane They built. They would not wipe Lorria clean, just restore it to a healthy state again. The angels were spread out about the Land and divided into their race groups, the Beings decided they were no longer capable of absolute coherance. To prevent a future war, the angels were given free choice of alignment, they were no longer directly affected by the balance of the manas. The weapons of The Great War were destroyed and their power of creation was stripped from them, they would now live at the mercy of nature. To appease Arconia, the angels were also stripped of their immortality. She would no longer poison the beings of the Prime Material Plane with her dark mana; they would remain in balance as intended. The Beings overlooked Andros, the God she had created during the War, for She had secured him away deep within The Abyss where his force was not easily detectable by the other Beings. She unleashed his dark power onto the Land of Lorria during The Regenesis.

<#b5><#c10>The Second Age</#c> - 
	The Second Age was but a shadow of The First Age, but it was a necessary step down. The beings of Lorria could not responsibly wield the power or creation and immortality given to them by the Supreme Beings. They now lived mortal lives at the mercy of the Land of Lorria. Each race now had recieved a domain upon which to dwell and build their kingdoms so as to avoid conflicts. The Elves recieved the forrests to the West, the Dwarves were granted the mountain ranges to the North, and the race of Man would live on the West coast of Lorria which would now be known as the Isle of Man. The other races recieved islands and the far-off lands beyond the Antrosic Ocean. At the beginning of the Age, the relationships between the races were neutral but as they began to trade and mingle, they forgot about The Great War and grew closer again. They would always remain seperated by race, however; never again would they reach the state of peace and harmony they saw in The First Age. Andros began to spread his evil across the Land of Lorria. Creatures of darkness began to spawn in shadows and from the dead recesses of the Badlands. But rather than creating conflict, Andros unified the races by creating a common enemy. They joined forces to eliminate his armies of darkness and keep safe their kingdoms. A company of men, elves, and dwarves, the strongest beings of the time, traveled to the depths of the Astral Plane of The Abyss and fought the God Andros. The combined power of the company was not enough to destroy Andros, but it was enough to seal him away along with all his evil. When they returned, light had returned to Lorria. They were praised as heroes and The Third Age of Lorria had begun.

<#b6><#c10>The Third Age</#c> - 
	The sealing of Andros ushered in a thousand cycles of peace and balance. The heroes who had accomplished the feat were embraced as the new leaders of their kingdoms, for no longer did the Land need kings of battle, it was a time of peace and unity. The bond the rulers shared from fighting in that company strengthened further the unity between races. As time passed, the heroes and their prosterity died and the people forgot of Andros and their struggle with him. His seal began to weaken and, slowly, tensions again grew and creatures of darkness again began to appear. The people ignored the signs that he was awakening but as anger and hatred grew and evil creatures began once more to roam the Land it was impossible to ignore. Disunity has grown to a level where a company amoung the races was no longer possible. The people wait for a hero to rise amoung them, one powerful enough to defeat Andros once and for all, before it is too late and darkness consumes the Land.
