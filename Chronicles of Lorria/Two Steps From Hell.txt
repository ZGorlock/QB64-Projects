Two Steps Cues Usage

We've been getting many requests every day to use our music in various productions free of charge. The rule here is if you have a personal project, that will not be sold or posted online on any commercial website, we do not mind. If you want to use the music in a video that will be posted online, that is used to promote a company, group or is in any way connected to an entity that makes a profit, we do not allow this. So let's say you are making a film in film school and used our music. This would be fine. If the film ends up being sold, or posted online with the Internet of promoting the filmmaker or cause, this is not allowed without permission. If our music ends up posted on too many projects, it is not great for us.
