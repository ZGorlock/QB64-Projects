Three Glooms -


Supreme Being: Portuon


Alignment: Neutral Evil


Greater Powers:
Anthraxus		The Decayed 					The most powerful daemon in the Lower Planes, occupying his mighty fortress the Khin-Oin, or Wasting Tower—a twenty mile (32 km) high citadel with dungeons that went just as deep underground.
Cyric			The Dark Sun					After the Time of Troubles took over the portfolios of Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul and set up a realm in the Three Glooms.
Hades									Had a realm in Pluton where the gates were guarded by the three-headed dog Cerberus.
Hel									Was the ruler of Niflheim where she guarded the dead.
Mask			The Lord of Shadows				Once lived here, dressed in colorful clothes but also a gray cloak.
Myrkul			Lord of Bones					Lived with his skeletons, zombies, and minor Deaths in the Castle of Bones.
Nergal			God of the Dead					Ruled a large part of Oinos from his circular city of seven concentric domes, Nergaltos. There he kept the prisoners Marduk brought to him.
Nidhogg									A huge, very ancient red dragon and her brood occupied (and consumed) the roots of Yggdrasil the World Ash, trying to break the conduit to Asgard. Nidhogg may be another name for Dendar the Night Serpent.

Yurtrus			The White Handed				Lived on the layer of Oinos.


Planes: 3
1	Oinos		The first layer of the Three Glooms was named for the lord of the daemons (the Oinodaemon), Anthraxus the Decayed. Oinos was the land of disease with stunted and withered plants amid gray rocky terrain. The river Styx flowed through this layer and there were portals to Tarterus, Gehenna, and Concordant Opposition that looked like huge spinning metal coins, visible for miles/kilometers, often guarded by iron fortresses. Anyone walking this land or floating on the river Styx had a chance of contracting a major disease. Many of the daemons and some of the other creatures from the lower middle planes who were immune to disease made their home here.
2	Niflheim	Compared to Oinos, the terrain in the second layer was rougher, like foothills, with cooler temperatures, healthier vegetation including pine trees, and no disease. Everything was cloaked in dreary fog and mist, limiting vision to about a hundred feet (thirty meters). Yggdrasil's roots reached Niflheim, connecting it to Asgard in Gladsheim.
3	Pluton		The lowest level of Hades contained the base of Mount Olympus, a direct conduit through the Astral Plane to the plane of Olympus/Arvandor. The gray motif continued throughout this layer but most of the vegetation was black willow trees and dry, dying poplars.
