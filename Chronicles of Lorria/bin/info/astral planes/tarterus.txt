Planes: 6
1	Othrys		The first layer of Tarterus was named for Mount Othrys (from Greek mythology) which was really two mountains on two adjacent orbs (both also called Othrys) each about fifty miles (80 km) high joined together at the peaks in a massive citadel. The worlds of Othrys were so close together that a traveler could easily fly from one to the next. For those who did not wish to fly, the river Styx flowed through all the worlds of this level in the usual mystical fashion. Many other rivers fed the Styx, and the surfaces of this layer were mostly marsh, bogs, and quicksand. Othrys was the brightest (due to the proximity of equal-sized worlds on either side) and warmest layer; no worse than a hot summer day on the Prime Material Plane. Other than the mountains, the ground was soft, like peat, and cut by deep chasms. Othrys could be reached via the Astral Plane and had portals to the Abyss, Hades, and Concordant Opposition. Long ago it could be reached via Mount Olympus, but when the Olympian gods overthrew the titans they used their combined might to shatter the part of the mountain that connected to Tarterus, thus trapping the titans on this plane.
2	Cathrys		The planets of the second layer were smaller that those of Othrys and about five hundred miles (800 km) apart. Plant life in this layer was both abundant and deadly. The flora in the overgrown jungles and grasslands secreted acid that could eat through metal in a minute or less.
3	Minethys	The third layer of Tarterus had planetoids smaller than those of Cathrys which hovered about five thousand miles (8,000 km) apart. The air between orbs was torn by harsh winds which carried poisonous dust storms from world to world, making most surfaces a barren desert. Huge tornadoes periodically swept through, carrying anything in its path to distant locations or even an adjacent orb.
4	Colothys	The worlds of the fourth layer were spiked with colossal mountains rising above deep chasms. Hundreds of miles/kilometers from base to peak, the terrain of this layer made the orbs more asymmetrical than in other layers. Adjacent orbs were five hundred thousand miles (800,000 km) apart so they appeared to be small spiky red moons in the utterly black sky. Legions of demons and daemons made lairs in the canyon walls.
5	Porphatys	Black, acidic rain and snow assailed the worlds of the fifth layer from giant black clouds that moved between them. The snow only stuck to the peaks of the mountains, melting to cover the rest of the surfaces with one to six feet (30 to 180 cm) of a weak acid that did not effect metal or stone but could eat away cloth in a minute or less. All barriers between this layer and the next were under water. The orbs of Porphatys were millions of miles/kilometers apart and barely discernible even when not blocked by demonic clouds.
6	Agathys		The smallest, coldest planetoids occupied the sixth layer and were so far apart that neighboring orbs could not be seen at all. Every surface was covered in dark ice that showed streaks of red and the air was so cold it made breathing difficult. If any layer existed beyond Agathys, the barriers would have been buried under miles/kilometers of ice.
