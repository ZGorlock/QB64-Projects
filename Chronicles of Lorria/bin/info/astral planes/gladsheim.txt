Planes: 3
1	Asgard			The name of this layer was also the name of the confederation of godly domains known as Asgard, home of the Norse pantheon. Each realm was the size of a Prime plane empire and they were drawn together by the proximity of Yggdrasil the World Ash. Like Mount Olympus, Yggdrasil was a multiplanar conduit connecting Gladsheim directly to Niflheim in Hades and Alternate Prime Material Planes without passing through the Astral Plane, much like the World Tree in the World Tree cosmology. The usual color pools connecting Asgard to the Astral Plane existed but were little used. Portals in the guise of wells connected this layer to the neighboring planes of Olympus/Arvandor, Limbo, and Concordant Opposition. In addition to Yggdrasil, the Norse gods controlled and carefully guarded a portal directly to the Prime plane where they were the strongest, called the Bifrost or the rainbow bridge. Other known realms adjacent to Asgard were Vanaheim (home of the Vanir, beings of the air), Alfheim (fairyland, known for its chaotic elven spirits), and Jotenheim (home of the giants).
2	Muspelheim		The earthbergs of this layer were reversed (or alternatively, gravity was reversed) so the flaming side was up and the earthen side down. Surtur and the fire giants made their home here and guarded the barriers that lead to Asgard and its neighboring realms.
3	Nidavellir		The rivers of earth were in such close proximity in this layer that the entire sky was filled with fire, making it appear to travelers that they were in underground caverns and passages with a river of fire for a ceiling.
