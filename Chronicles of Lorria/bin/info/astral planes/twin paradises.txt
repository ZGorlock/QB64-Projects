Twin Paradises -


Supreme Being: Pallas


Alignment: Lawful Good / Neutral Good


Greater Powers:
Ilmater 		The Crying God, God of Endurance, Suffering,	Once held a realm in the Twin Paradises, on the layer of Shurrock, called Martyrdom.
			  Martyrdom, and Perseverance


Planes: 2
1	Dothion		Dothion was a bucolic land of old forests and huge meadows subject to mild seasonal changes and gentle weather. Portals to Seven Heavens, Elysium, and Concordant Opposition were found in caverns as brightly glowing patterns: concentric circles for the Seven Heavens, radiating lines for Elysium, and both patterns superimposed, which resembled a spider web, for Concordant Opposition. Travelers from the Astral Plane would emerge from the color pools on this layer.
2	Shurrock	Across the barrier, Shurrock had much the same landscape features but much harsher weather: summers were hot and winters were long and cold. Storms were more common here, with booming thunder and heavy rains. Life on the Shurrock side was more challenging and kept the inhabitants busy, but both sides were virtuously industrious
