Elysium -


Supreme Being: Elion


Alignment: Neutral Good


Greater Powers:
Chauntea		The Great Mother and Goddess of Agriculture 	Once lived in Elysium.
Enlil									Once made his home in the mountains of Eronia.
Ishtar			The Goddess of Love and War			Once had a realm in Amoria centered on a great city surrounding a half-mile (800 meter) statue of herself. The statue glowed, supplying her realm with light.
Isis									Had a large realm in Amoria which she kept lit by lanterns in the trees and secured by patrolling moon dogs.
Lathander		The Morninglord, God of Beginnings, Birth,	Had a rosy realm in Elysium.
			  Conception, Dawn, Eternal Youth, Renewal,
			  Self-Perfection, Spring, and Vitality
Mystra			Midnight					The mortal that ascended to godhood during the Time of Troubles, eventually made her divine realm a shining city called Dweomerheart and placed it atop a large plateau in Eronia. Dweomerheart became its own plane in the World Tree cosmology model and was later destroyed upon the death of Mystra.
Nanna-Sin		God of the Moon					Traveled throughout Elysium in his great barque shaped like a crescent moon bringing moonlight to all the banks of Oceanus.


Planes: 4
1	Amoria		The first layer, Amoria, also referred to as the "innermost" layer, was connected to the Astral Plane by color pools and to Twin Paradises, Happy Hunting Grounds, and Concordant Opposition by unmarked portals located in dark caverns. Divination spells were required to determine the destination of these portals with certainty. Navigating the river Oceanus downstream also led to the Happy Hunting Grounds but any underground passages were not likely to be safe for boats. Amoria best fit the description given above and the river Oceanus had many side channels that split and merged back again, creating many "banks" for the establishment of realms.
2	Eronia		The second layer of Elysium was very mountainous and many branches of the Oceanus became spectacular waterfalls and tumbling cascades before forming channels bordered by steep cliffs of gray rock. Like Amoria, Eronia supported abundant wildlife along the banks.
3	Belierin	Contrary to Eronia, Belierin was mostly flat with marshes and wetlands stretching inland for miles/kilometers before larger plants and trees were found. Oceanus split and formed many island nations inhabited by extraplanar beings.
4	Thalasia	The fourth and "outermost" layer of Elysium was a great ocean, sometimes called the Thalasian sea, that was both the source and final destination of the river Oceanus. Small islands were scattered about but no big land masses existed here.
