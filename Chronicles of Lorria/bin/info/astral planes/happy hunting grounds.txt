Planes: 3
1	Krigala		Krigala was the upper layer, connected to the Astral Plane by color pools and to Elysium, Olympus/Arvandor, and Concordant Opposition by portals disguised as large holes in hollow trees. The river Oceanus flowed in a relatively straight course from Amoria in Elysium through Krigala on its way to Olympus. The sky was perpetually lit by a noonday sun directly overhead regardless of distance traveled.
2	Brux		The second layer of the Beastlands was constantly in dusk or dawn due to two suns on opposite ends of the horizon, hovering there and turning the sky a reddish hue. The landscape of Brux was similar to that found in Krigala.
3	Karasuthra	The bottommost layer was the land of starlight. Above any clouds or fog that might exist in a region was a clear night sky full of wandering stars. The stars moved randomly such that all attempts to map them into constellations were unsuccessful.
