Abyss -


Supreme Being: Arconia


Alignment: Chaotic Evil


Greater Powers:
Ahazu			The Seizer					
Baphomet								Created an infinite maze that changed form as it passed between layers. It was populated by a variety of minotaurs said to have breath weapons or magical abilities.
Beshaba			The Goddess of Mischief and Maid of Misfortune	
Dagon									Controlled a watery layer filled with hezrou and aquatic dretch.
Demogorgon								Controlled several layers, each filled with dinosaurs, wild apes, and flying monsters as well as the usual demonkind.
Eltab									Lurked on this plane in the "Hidden Layer".
Fraz-Urb'luu								Had a realm that reportedly rivaled the beauty of the Twin Paradises or Arvandor but it was an illusion covering decay and rotting flesh.
Graz'zt									Had a great palace that covered an entire layer where he would marshal his armies to fight Orcus and Demogorgon.
Juiblex									Lived in a layer full of fungus and rot, where slimes and molds fed off the decaying matter of the plane, and each other.
Kostchtchie								Controlled only part of a layer, but his ice palace was filled with creatures of cold.
Laogzed			God of Troglodytes				
Lolth									Spun her webs on the 65th layer in the midst of a maelstrom that was the portal to her abode on the 66th layer before she became a greater god and removed her Demonweb Pits from the Abyss to join the fiendish planes. After the Spellplague her realm survived to float in the Astral Sea.
Obox-ob									
Orcus									Had an enormous palace made of bones, rising out of a field of bone dust. He employed many undead as his guards and servants.
Pale Night		The Mother of Demons				Lived in a bone castle in the maze of Baphomet and controlled her own layer called Androlynne.
Pazuzu									Had no real home but controlled the skies above every layer of the Abyss. He, like Charon on the Styx, controlled a primary mode of travel in the Abyss and was respected if not feared.
The Queen of Chaos							Ruled the fourteenth layer called the Steaming Fen.
Sseth			The God of the Yuan-ti				Was imprisoned in the Abyss by Set.
Tharizdun		The God of Destruction				Was imprisoned in a remote layer of the Abyss during the Dawn War.
Umberlee		The Bitch Queen 				
Urdlen									The evil gnome deity carved his realm out of a layer of solid rock, crisscrossing it with tunnels filled with hate for beautiful things.
Vaprak			Deity of Trolls and Father of Ogres		Had a realm here on a layer called Shatterstone.
Yeenoghu								Had a mansion the size of a city that rolled across barren salt flats, pulled by slaves driven by gnolls.
Zuggtmoy								Had several realms scattered throughout the layers, all echos of normal environments but bathed in a purplish light and being overtaken by fungus and fungoid creatures.


Planes: 666
1	Jhaat			Most common Astral entry layer to the Abyss, this layer also connects to Stygia, Pandemonium, and Sarendathos, as well as approximately 83 internal layers (one-eighth of the Abyssal planes)
4				Court of Aeskylos, the Shaper.  This plane is animate and malleable to his whim, and connects to layer 500.
12				Court of Shabriri.  This plane connects to the layer 393.
45				A desert plane of arid scrub, which connects to Syrithol (Xalta's first plane), and layers 205, 361, and 425.
54				Court of Sceirion.  All four planes are interconnected throughout, and share planar geographical features.  The Keep of Rhieaz is Sceirion's stronghold.   
65				Court of Lolth, Demon Queen of Spiders.  The 65th layer is Lolth's secondary domain and hidey hole, the 66th is her web.  Her web connects to the layer 500, and both layers connect to various alternate Primes through permanent gates that Lolth has created as invasion routes.
73				A Prime-like layer wracked by constant storms.  It also connects to layer 371.
74				Stygia impinges upon this layer.
79				A Prime-like plane of magical weakness.  No spells greater than 6th level will function (including magic item effects).  This plane connects to layer 371.
85				A mountainous layer, and home to many abyssal dragons, this was also the court of the Tiamat pretender Miatta.  Miatta's hoard and consorts were scattered after her demise at the hands of Trillz the Dark.  
101	The Endless Enigma	A prison layer of non-euclidean and tesseractian chambers, created through the combined powers of Alrunes, Fraz-Urb'luu, Sceirion, Obox-ob, and Abraxus.  This level is often the destination of gate traps.  The only being to have ever escaped its confines, Baphomet, entered on a bet and emerged 7500 years later.  Most demonic scholars believe that each of the plane's creators built special strongholds and caches throughout its structures.  In addition to creatures indigenous to this unique environment, the plane is inhabited by various failed experiments, political prisoners, invaders, adventurers (Prime-planar, demonic, and otherwise), and such.   
120				Court of Yeenoghu, Demon Lord of Gnolls and Ghouls.  Layer 120 is a hilly, forested plane, and Yeenoghu's personal domain where he hunts.  Layer 121 has similar geography, and is a training-ground for Yeenoghu's gnolls, gnoles, gholes, thouls, ghouls, trolls, and legions of demons.   
149				Court of Baphomet, High King of Demonkind.  Baphomet's layer is mazey, with various open "courtyards" that contain forests, seas, and his palace (at the center of the plane, of course).  The demon Belitfint is Baphomet's chief aide and major domo.  This layer connects to Labyarax (Sarendathos' first layer).  
153				This chaos plane connects to Limbo and layer 371.
184				This plane is an empty husk, a barren vacuum.  An open conduit to the Negative Material plane has drained this plane of all life.  For all practical purposes, this plane is an extension of the Negative Material Plane, and all magics that require contact with that plane function normally on this layer of the Abyss.  
212				The Dead Court of Orcus.  These planes are a huge graveyard wherein all known and unknown forms of undead are represented among the populace.  Chadun is Orcus' chief lieutenant, who controls entrance to the plane through the unnamed city of bones which guards access to Orcus' realm.  
222				Court of Tsuggtmoy, Demon Queen of Fungi.  This layer is a vast plain of moldering fungus which sinks into vaporous swampy masses of putrescence.  Rivers and lakes of slime cross its surface.  Tsuggtmoy holds court in a bowl-like depression in the lowest depths of the layer's swamps.  This plane connects to layer 457.
229	  			A spatial plane of white and black geometry, clouded by shades of grey.  This plane is home to many xuphaitz demons, and other, odder creatures.  Think M. C. Escher.  This layer connects to layer 371.
246				A prime-like layer of rifts, hills, and craggy mountains.  This plane is home to many races of giants, and connects to layers 444 and 471 (Kostchtchie).  
247				A swampy fen layer which houses many will-o-wisps, hags, lower demons, etc.  This plane connects to Xalta's plane Ocanthrus, and also serves as a temporary home for those who wander in from there (stray Abishai and Barbed devils, the explorative barghest, etc.).  
248				Stygia impinges on the Abyss again on this plane, and forms a large "lake" (anywhere but the Abyss it would be an ocean).    
267				Library of Gresil.  Three planes of row and rows of books, scrolls, tapestries, and other records enclosed in stone shelves.  Paved flagstone floors and walls, ceiling that just go up . . .  Gresil's library demons now who is permitted to delve the archives.  This plane is neutral ground, at least temporarily, as few demons are willing to risk Gresil's wrath.  
294				"The Incessantly Sublime Court" of the departed (?) Obox-ob.  This plane plays with one's mind, body, and soul.  It connects to layer 393.
307				Stygia impinges . . . 
317				Decadent Court of Noticular, Mistress of Vampires, wherein all you see is fit to eat, drink, or drain . . . . 
329-346	The Court of Graz'zt	This covers far too much planar ground to bother going into any detail here.  Layer 333 is Graz'zt's seat of power, and connects to layer 393.  
340				Once-court of Morflos, Balrog Lord, absorbed by Graz'zt in its owner's absence.
350				Court of Azazel, Demon Lord of Snakes.  These planes are amazonian jungle levels filled with rainforests, rivers, and snakes in all colors, shapes, and sizes.  Yuan-ti and  ssilhex are native.  Demogorgon is known to have visited this plane prior to his disappearance.   
371				A barren and rocky plane which was once volcanic.  Obsidian shards and ashen desert wastes.  This plane connects to layers 73, 79, 153, 229, and 407; Stygia also crosses this layer's schalla (toward Pandemonium).
381				Once-court of Pazeuzeus.  A spatial layer with pewter sky, no sun, and murky clouds in a variety of colors (purple, brown, black, deep ocean green).  Pazeuzeus' open-aired cloud palace floats randomly about the plane since his insanity.  
393	Zegrentilandib		This plane is sentient, and Prime-like, but with fleshy ground.  This plane is a nexus, and connects to Stygia, Mykhaz (Sarendathos' fourth plane), 12 (Aeskylos), 294 (Obox-ob), 333 (Graz'zt), 407 (Mandrillagon), and 19 other layers (1, 7, 36, 49, 85, 143, 172, 179, 300, 309, 364, 389, 396, 404, 462, 512, 599, 646).
407				Forest planes of Mandrillagon, filled with huge trees, apes, various and sundry primates, tribes of primitive humans?, etc.  Plane 407 connects to layer 393.  
421				Soneillon's Gardens and Salons of Debauchery.  A largely Prime-like, though small, plane, Soneillon's Court offers the finest arts of harlotry, hedonism, and such . . . .
432				A tiered plane, which connects to the depths of Mykhaz (Sarendathos' fourth plane), with a fair amount of daemonical traffic.
444				A sentient plane, with bestial appetites and instincts.  It tries to gobble up those who intrude upon it by animating itself in interesting manners.  It connects to layer 246.  
451				A Prime-like plane of dark forests, with no sun and seven moons.  Many drow live here, or make it a point to visit this layer while in the Abyss.  This layer connects to Chamada (Hades' third plane), and many daemons and gigantes travel between the realms.
453				Stygia impinges
457				Once-court of the deceased demon lord Juiblex.  This layer is being annexed by Tsuggtmoy, who can offer some consolation to the lordless slimes, jellies, puddings, etc.  This plane connects to layer 222.
471				Court of Kostchtchie.  471 is a frozen, mountainous layer, covered over by glaciation, and home to frost giants.  472 and 473 are tundra plains covered with fir forests and share a sun.  474, recently taken, is a temperate Prime-like layer which is now succumbing to an ice age.  Plane 471 connects to layer 246.
492				Stygia impinges in a cascading waterfall, which pools in a large lake, and drains out of the Abyss.  Ancient watch towers stand on either shore of the falls; they are generally unoccupied.  
500				A Prime-like, tiered layer with two white suns and a ringed, asteroid-strewn sky of purple (with silver/pewter clouds).  This plane connects to Stygia, Pazandillan and Pheletho (Sarendathos' second and third planes), as well as layers 4, 65, 546, and twelve others (1, 19, 27, 200, 257, 285, 304, 416, 438, 449, 497, and 602).
510				Court of Aseroth, Demon Lord of Githyanki and Regent of the Silver Realm.  This layer is essentially a demonic Astral plane, and spells that require a connection to that plane will function normally.  Githyanki, astral islands, and voidships abound, in addition to the usual motley assortment of demons.
528				Court of Socothbenoth.  A Prime-like realm, with cities, sky ships, and a Lord among the Firstborn.  Uliel, a balrog of considerable power, is Socothbenoth's castellan.
532				A Prime-like plane of magical strength which allows up to 10th level spells to function, with and temporal distortion as a side-effect.  This effect usually manifests as accelerated aging.  Alrunes is the only being who habitually uses this plane, and it is often another popular destination for gate traps.
546				Court of Demogorgon (see his listing for a description in detail).  Layer 546 connects to layer 500.  
564				Stygia impinges on the Abyss in a gaseous, Bespin-like spatial layer.  Styx is a free-floating stream, with no bed.
606				Court of Gothmog, Demon Lord of Balrogs.  A hellish set of volcanically-paired planes:  layer 606 is the mounts, vents, ash, and slag, while 607 is an underground maze of passages, lava tubes, magma lakes, etc.  Gothmog's palace rests on a vast pool of bubbling lava, in a huge crater.  
637	Carynach		This plane's name means "The Empty Place" in demonic.  It is a mystery level, since no other layers connect or allow entrance to it.  No gates will open to this plane, from anywhere in the mulitverse.   
651				Stygia impinges
656				Prime-like, a heavily fortified plane which connects to Avernus (Hell's first plane).  
662				An oceanic, Prime-like layer with island chains, a pink sun, yellow sky, white clouds, and blue/green water.  The Ethereal plane connects to this layer, and magics which require contact with that plane will function normally here.  
666				Court of the missing Fraz-Urb'luu.  An illusory layer of deception.  This plane is under Fraz-Urb'luu's mental control.  It currently appears flat and featureless.
