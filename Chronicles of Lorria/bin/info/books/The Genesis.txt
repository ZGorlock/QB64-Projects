The Supreme Beings of the astral planes of existance once gathered in the a void area of the material realm. Their purpose was to align their mana fields to create a new material plane: the Prime Material Plane. They sang the plane into being and in an instance all of the infinities of space and time burst into existance. The Supreme Beings drew from the matter of the Elemental Material Planes and filled the Prime Material Plane with its matrix of prime material. In addition, each Being flooded the Plane with Its own field of mana, the energy that would act as fuel to animate the matrix; the life force of the Plane. It was agreed that each Being's mana would be kept in balance so that no one Force gained too much power of the plane, so no one Being would become more powerful than the others. For the Plane acts as a two-way energy source; the Supreme Being would make available Its mana for the beings of the plane and, in return, the more the life force of the plance aligned with the Being's mana field, the more powerful and more prominent It becomes. The Beings, together, chose an area at the center of the Plane and decided to focus their mana on it. This land was named Lorria and would act as the spiritual epicenter of the Prime Material Plane. Each of the Supreme Beings created life for Lorria: vegetation, creatures, and beats, and, finally, a race of free-willed planar beings to represent and honor Its astral plane. These races of angels, each of a different alignment, would live together peacfully, resulting in a mutually beneficial, symbiotic link between the Prime Material Plane and the Astral Planes. The Prime Material Plane would forever act as a shadow of the Astral, Ethereal, and Material Planes, the focal point of the new Multiverse, and at the heart of this Plane was the Land of Lorria.
