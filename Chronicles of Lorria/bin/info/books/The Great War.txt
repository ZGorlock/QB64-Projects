As tensions grew during The First Age, the angels started to form alliances amoung their races and battle with the other alliances. These battles were over things like territory and resources, they had forgoten how to coexist. The battles became more and more frequent and destructive and eventually the alliances declared war on each other. These battles had left a scar on Lorria that would never heal, this was now called The Badlands. Arconia had grown so powerful that she was able to create a God out of the darkness and evil that plagued Lorria, she called this God Andros and hid him deep within The Abyss. The alliances of Lorria began to use their power of creation to construct huge weapons of war, weapons that would be capable of tearing the Plane apart. All sides stocked up on these weapons, none willing to use them until absolutely necessary. A hundred moons passed at this stalemate until, eventually, the angel armies gathered in the Plains of Eckldor to end the War. They armed their weapons and prepared for a battle they knew would lead to nothing but destruction. The Supreme Beings of the Astral Planes could stand by no longer. They put an end to this War and prepared to rebalance the Plane. This rebalancing would be remembered as The Regenesis.
