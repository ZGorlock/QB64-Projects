For tens of thousands of moons, the angels of Lorria lived in perfect harmony. The angels of each Supreme Being lived amoungst each other peacefully, sharing everything and helping each other. They used their power of creation to construct incredible structures and powerful magical objects and to mold the world as they saw fit. They lived without troubles, conflict, or fear. Arconia, the Supreme Being of absolute Chaotic Evil, grew tired of this, however, and over time She slowly increased the presence of her mana field in Lorria, breaking the oath They took when They first created the Prime Material Plane. This increase in Chaotic Evil mana density manifested itself in anger, fear, greed, jealously, and hatred amoung the angels. They lost their harmony and their existances began to conflict. These conflicts would eventually result in The Great War.
