The sealing of Andros ushered in a thousand moons of peace and balance. The heroes who had accomplished the feat were embraced as the new leaders of their kingdoms, for no longer did the Land need kings of battle, it was a time of peace and unity. The bond the rulers shared from fighting in that company strengthened further the unity between races. As time passed, the heroes and their prosterity died and the people forgot of Andors and their struggle with him. His seal began to weaken and, slowly, tensions again grew and creatures of darkness again began to appear. The people ignored the signs that he was awakening but as anger and hatred grew and evil creatures began once more to roam the Land it was impossible to ignore. Disunity has grown to a level where a company amoung the races is no longer possible. The people wait for a hero to rise amoung them, one powerful enough to defeat Andros once and for all, before it is too late and darkness consumes the Land.
