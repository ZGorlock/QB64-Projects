The Second Age was but a shadow of The First Age, but it was a necessary abasement. The beings of Lorria could not responsibly wield the power or creation and immortality given to them by the Supreme Beings. They now lived mortal lives at the mercy of the Land of Lorria. Each race now had recieved a domain upon which to dwell and build their kingdoms so as to avoid conflicts. The Elves recieved the forrests to the West, the Dwarves were granted the mountain ranged to the North, and the race of Man would live on the West coast of Lorria which would now be known as the Isle of Man. The other races recieved islands and the far-off lands beyond the Antrosic Ocean. At the beginning of the Age, the relationships between the races were neutral but as they began to trade and mingle, they forgot about The Great War and grew closer again. They would always remain seperated by race, however; never again would they be able to reach the state of peace and harmony they experienced in The First Age. Andros began to spread his evil across the Land of Lorria. Creatures of darkness began to spawn in shadows and from the dead recesses of the Badlands they migrated. But rather than creating conflict, Andros unified the races by creating a common enemy. They joined forces to eliminate his armies of darkness and keep safe their kingdoms. A company of seven men, elves, and dwarves, the strongest beings of the time, traveled to the depths of the Astral Plane of The Abyss and fought the God Andros. The combined power of the company was not enough to destroy Andros, but it was enough to seal him away along with all his evil. When they returned, light had returned to Lorria. They were praised as heroes and The Third Age of Lorria had begun.
