The Supreme Beings of the Astral Planes watched the angels of Lorria fall to the influence of the darkness and slip into war, a war that would destroy them. They had to intervene to end the War and save the Plane They had built. They would not wipe Lorria clean, just restore it to a healthy state again. The angels were spread out about the Land and divided into their race groups, the Beings decided they were no longer capable of absolute coherance. To prevent a future war, the angels were given free choice of alignment, they were no longer directly affected by the balance of the manas. The weapons of The Great War were destroyed and their power of creation was stripped from them, they would now live at the mercy of nature. To appease Arconia, the angels were also stripped of their immortality. She would no longer poison the beings of the Prime Material Plane with her dark mana; they would remain in balance as intended. The Beings overlooked Andros, the God she had created during the War, for She had secured him away deep within The Abyss where his force was not easily detectable by the other Beings. She unleashed his dark power onto the Land of Lorria during The Regenesis.
