Goblin are the humanoid vermin of the mountains. Although not as mortally as their troll relatives, their skin deteriorates in the presence of bright light and therefore they can thrive only in darkness. With a reptilian nature they must live deep within the mountain they inhabit in order to keep warm. These factors greatly limit their range to the mountains although they are sometimes encountered in caves have been reported in the dense forests to the South. Goblin have a life span of about 25 years but the youth and elderly are kept under stict protection deep in the mountain. They have a malevolent nature and are likely to attack even when not provoked. Although fairly unintelligent they have developed a form of language that is specific to the mountain where they were born. Goblin are incredibly social amoungst themselves but loathe almost all beings outside their own race. They are Lawful Evil in alignment but relate to no diety. They have learned to work with leather and iron to make basic weapons and armour. They are not magical so they rely on their weapons, claws, and teeth to inflict damage to intruders. They sometimes carry with them some small gem or precious stone with which they connect with the mountain. A great mass of gold and gems are usually stored with the king at the heart of their caverns; a true bounty for those intrepid enough to claim it.
