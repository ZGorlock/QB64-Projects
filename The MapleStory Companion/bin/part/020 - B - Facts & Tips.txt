This is because Maplstory stores its information as a 32-bit signed binary integer. Binary means they store numbers as 1s or 0s, a 1 meaning it is turned on, a 0 meaning it is turned off. Each digit up on the string is the next factor of two. For example, '10110' means ((0 * 2^0) + (1 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^4)) = (0 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 16) = 22. They store information in a 32-bit system. This means that there can not be data string longer than 32 0s or 1s. 2^31-1 = 2147483647. It is signed meaning it needs a space to tell if it is positive or negative. And we need one bit as a 0 so that leaves us with 2^31-1. But why the -1? The actual range of a 32 bit integer is -2147483648=<X<=2147483647. 32bit is really 2^32 which equals 2147483648 which means we have 2147483648 possible values, excluding the signed part. However you are able to hold 0 mesos. So instead of being able to hold from 1 to 2147483648 mesos, you are able to hold from 0 to 2147483647 mesos."
