Warriors possess a skill called Improving Max HP Increase that raises their max HP more than usual with every level gained. If this skill is maxed as soon as possible after changing classes, the warrior will have at least double the max HP of that of Thieves and Archers, and at least quadruple that of the Mage. Warriors also have 2 attacking skills: Power Strike, which does large amounts of damage to one enemy and Slash Blast, which can attack up to 6 enemies near the character. Warrior armor has the highest weapon defense in the game. Since warriors require both STR and DEX, they choose to wear armor that increases STR or DEX. The warrior weapons consist of many classes, and the second job advancement will affect which weapon one will choose to use for the rest of the game. The jobs are Fighter, Page, and Spearman and each class masters a different set of weapons. When the job advancement test is complete, the player will have to choose between the different jobs, and must take into consideration the HP and MP boosts each job grants.

An added advantage of 'Ice Charge' is its ability to freeze monsters temporarily, but applying only 105% damage when maxed. 'Fire Charge' applies 120% damage, and many monsters are weak against fire, while 'Lightning' applies 125% damage, making it the most useful against enemies that aren't weak against any elements and cannot be frozen. In addition to charging their weapon, White Knights can use the 'Charged Blow' skill to deal 250% damage to up to 6 monsters at once and stun the enemy with a 90% chance when the skill is maxed. The stun time is 10 seconds, or 5 seconds if the enemy is attacked while stunned, the latter being a possibly unique property the White Knight class 'Charged Blow' cancels out the charge but keeps the elemental attribute.

They are relatively weak at lower levels but become much stronger as they reach higher levels. An archer's damage is based mainly on DEX, which is where most stat points are placed, whereas STR is raised to meet equipment requirements. Archers cannot attack monsters from a short range, so when a monster gets too close, they swing their bow or crossbow in an attempt to knock the monster away. Success rates for knocking the monster back depend on the knockback rate of the weapon, with stronger bows and crossbows having higher chances of knocking the enemy back. Archers also have the largest damage range of any class making their damage highly inconsistent. All of an archer's skill are used to improve their damage dealing capabilities and their other weaknesses, however they have no party-support skills. A vital skill for an archer is Eye of Amazon, which increases the range of arrows. Critical Shot gives a chance of doing bonus damage with every arrow shot. Arrow Blow is an active skill that deals more damage than a regular shot, having high knockback rate. Double Shot allows the archer to fire two arrows at once, each with their own ability to do critical damage.

Bow Mastery raises the minimum damage and accuracy of hunters. Power Knockback lets a Hunter swing their bow to attack multiple enemies, giving a boost to their knockback rate. Arrow Bomb is a skill that will explode when the arrow contacts an enemy, damaging and possibly stunning up to six surrounding enemies as well. Bow Booster is a skill that increases the rate of fire of the bow. Final Attack allows the chance to randomly, and quickly, fire another arrow after using an attacking skill.

As beginners, due to the lack of STR and DEX, magicians are very weak. The first job advancement for Magicians is at Level 8, as opposed to Level 10 for the other 3 classes, and requires 20 INT. This gives magicians more SPs (Skill Points) than the other classes during the 1st job and allows the use of skills sooner. Similar to Warrior's Improving Max HP Increase, magicians have Improving Max MP Increase, which is typically maxed immediately in order to increase their MP as much as possible. Magicians improve very quickly during the 1st job, and at about Level 20 can easily do much more damage than the other classes at the same level. This is largely due to the powerful 1st job spell Magic Claw, which like all magician spells comes with 'mastery', which raises the spell's minimum damage to a significant percentage of the maximum damage, allowing more stable, higher damage. The other most important 1st job magician skill is Magic Guard, which diverts a percentage of the damage taken to the magician's MP instead of HP, effectively giving them thousands of HP.

It requires both hands for claw thief to throw stars, so they are unable to wear a shield. Similarly to Bowmen, claw thieves convert to a weak melee attack when monsters get too close. Dagger thieves use daggers to perform melee attacks. There are two types of daggers: STR and LUK daggers. STR daggers tend to be faster at lower levels and require some points to be placed in STR.
