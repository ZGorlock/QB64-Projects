This is the land of Ardendore
Or at least it used to be...
Many years ago, the Lord of Darkness, Ganirelix, rose to power
He has slowly consumed the entire planet
Well, all but the Kingdom of Arx, we have held back his hoardes here
Yes... I am in the Resistance
My parents were at one point too... They were both killed in a raid
I was raised in the Resistance, they are my family
The Resistance grows weaker everyday... We are hunted
We wont be able to hold them back much longer
...
I have been training, I will avenge my parents and the Resistance
I will make sure that it is by my hand that he falls
Ganirelix, I'm coming for you, so get ready!
